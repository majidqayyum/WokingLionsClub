                    <p>For more than 30 years Woking Lions have been garnering Harvest Festival and other goods from Churches and schools around Woking. These together with fund raising to purchase fresh food, toys and other goodies have enabled us to give out many Christmas parcels to those in need every Christmas time since the mid 1980's. For more than half this time, the co-ordination of this project has been ably led by Pat Maguire, assisted by other Lions in collating the goods and finding the names and addresses of those in need of help so that all our members can distribute them in the week leading up to Christmas.</p>

                    <p>Numbers of parcels delivered across the Borough and beyond have steadily increased, so that over the last two years numbers have reached just below 180 in 2014 and 185 in December 2014. This together with our Christmas Day Meal for lonely people at Moorcroft every year for a similar length of time, have been two of the main smaller charity events which Woking Lions have worked hard to help keep running over all these years.</p>

                    <p>The Lions cater for over eighty elderly persons in their  annual Christmas Day meal held at the Moorcroft  Centre who would otherwise be alone on Christmas Day. Last year we were helped by very generous donations from Waitrose Stores, St.  Dunstan’s  church  and our  bucket  shaking  events  at  the  various  shopping  stores.  The wonderful aspect of the day was the help from our volunteers who gave up the Christmas Day to help others. If you would like to help on the day please do contact us, we would be happy to hear from you.</p>
